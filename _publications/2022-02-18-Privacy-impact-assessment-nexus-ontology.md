The intersection of the Internet of Things and Privacy domains has created new, unprecedented complexity. 
There are substantial knowledge gaps around how to estimate the impact of IoT devices on the privacy of an individual. 
Semantic data structures are a promising prospect, but are hampered by their cumbersome size, domain specificity and very manual development approaches. 
This thesis describes the application of agile ontology development approaches to develop the Privacy Impact Assessment Nexus Ontology (PIANO) and the Social Internet of Things Knowledgebase. 
The development of the knowledgebase employs semi-automated ontology learning to derive new knowledge about the intersection of IoT devices and an individualâ€™s privacy. 
The development and evaluation usecase is derived from the Social Internet of Things project dataset, and its application reveals the significant potential of PIANO, and importantly the development methodology that is driving its development to finally bridging the gap between IoT and Personal Privacy. 
The conditions are set for future work in this area, linking the abstract PIANO structure to granular IoT and Personal ontologies, demonstrating its utility outside of a pure proof-of-concept simulation
