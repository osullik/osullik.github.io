This paper outlines the requirements for a series of ontologies necessary to provide a meaningful answer to the question: How do we model and simulate the System of Systems effects of a cyber attack on an organization or military unit? 
This work provides the data model specification for a simulation to answer this question by explaining the required domains of knowledge. 
We introduce mechanisms to federate these domains, and then provide an exemplar use-case to contextualize one type of scenario the model must be capable of representing within a simulation environment. 
The model demonstrates the granularity necessary for the modeling and simulation of a SoS effect of a cyber attack on an organization or military unit.
