I am a PhD Student at the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-computer-science.html) studying Natural Language Processing under [Jonathan Kummerfeld](https://jkk.name/) and [Tongliang Liu](https://tongliang-liu.github.io/). 
I am a [2022 Fulbright Scholar](https://www.fulbright.org.au/2022-alumni/#Kent-osullivan) and have broad research interests in Natural Language Processing, applied Artificial Intelligence, Cyber Security, and Geospatial Computing. 
My overarching research goal is to improve the scale and reliability of automated information fusion and intelligence analysis to support decision making by extracting and structuring information gathered from our messy, unstructured world.
